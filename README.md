## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get Remasa up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Manual Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    First, clone the Remasa repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Remasa/Remasa.git
    cd Remasa
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    It's good practice to work within a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install all required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Environment Configuration**:
    The application might require location data or specific API keys for prayer time calculation. These details might be configured through environment variables or a configuration file (refer to the `Usage Examples` section for details).


## üí° Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run the `sholat-timer.py` script to start receiving prayer time reminders.

### Basic Usage

To run the prayer timer, simply execute the main script:

```bash
python sholat-timer.py
```

This will typically display the current prayer times and start the reminder service.

### Configuration

Remasa might offer configuration options for:
*   **Location**: Manually setting latitude and longitude if automatic detection is not preferred.
*   **Calculation Method**: Choosing different Islamic prayer time calculation methods (e.g., MWL, ISNA, Egypt).
*   **Notification Preferences**: Customizing reminder sounds or display methods.

These options can usually be set within the `sholat-timer.py` script or a separate configuration file.

_Example of configuration (conceptual):_
```python
# Inside sholat-timer.py or a config.py
LOCATION = {"latitude": -6.2088, "longitude": 106.8456} # Example: Jakarta
CALC_METHOD = "MWL" # Muslim World League
```



## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

Remasa is continuously evolving. Here are some of the planned features and improvements:

*   **Version 1.1.0**:
    *   Implement a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
    *   Allow users to select their location from a predefined list or map.
    *   Add support for more prayer time calculation methods.
*   **Future Enhancements**:
    *   Cross-platform desktop notifications (e.g., using `plyer`).
    *   Integration with external APIs for more precise location data.
    *   Ability to customize notification sounds and messages.
    *   Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
